This script is an Instagram Status Checker for AdsPower Profiles that automates checking and managing multiple Instagram accounts. Here's how it works:
Overview
The script checks the status of Instagram accounts managed through AdsPower (a browser profile management tool) and updates their status in an Airtable database. It can also attempt to automatically log in to accounts that are logged out.
Key Components
1. Profile Management

AdsPower Integration: Controls browser profiles through AdsPower's API
Airtable Database: Stores profile information including:

Profile numbers
Current status (Alive, Logged out, Suspended, Disabled, etc.)
Login credentials (username, password, 2FA secrets)



2. Main Workflow
1. User selects profiles to check:
   - By range (e.g., profiles 2090-2100)
   - From Airtable view (e.g., all "Logged Out" profiles)

2. Sets concurrent processing limit (how many profiles to check simultaneously)

3. For each profile:
   a. Starts AdsPower browser profile
   b. Connects to the browser using Selenium
   c. Navigates to Instagram
   d. Detects account status
   e. If logged out, attempts auto-login
   f. Updates status in Airtable
   g. Closes profile
3. Status Detection
The script can detect these Instagram account states:

Alive: Account is logged in and functional
Logged out: Needs login credentials
Phone verification required: Instagram requesting phone number
Challenge required: Suspicious activity detected
Suspended: Account temporarily suspended
Disabled: Account permanently disabled
Error: Unable to determine status

4. Auto-Login Feature
When an account is logged out, the script:

Fills in username and password from Airtable
Handles 2FA if needed (generates TOTP codes)
Manages various Instagram popups and consent screens
Verifies login success

5. Key Features

Concurrent Processing: Can check multiple profiles simultaneously
Thread Safety: Uses locks to prevent conflicts when multiple threads access shared resources
Human-like Behavior: Types credentials character by character with delays
Popup Handling: Manages Instagram's various consent screens and notifications
Error Recovery: Attempts to restart profiles if they're already running
